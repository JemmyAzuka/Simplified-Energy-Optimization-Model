## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model and associated code for optimizing heating, cooling, and lighting systems in a building for energy efficiency while maintaining comfort. The model is designed to make predictions and recommendations based on synthetic data, taking into consideration factors such as temperature, lighting intensity, occupancy, and time of day.


## Usage
The primary usage of this model is to optimize heating, cooling, and lighting systems in a building for energy efficiency while maintaining comfort. You can use the model to make predictions and recommendations based on input data, including temperature, lighting intensity, occupancy, and time-of-day.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your data or use the synthetic data provided in the repository.

2. Use the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

3. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to fine-tune the model for your specific use case.

4. Integrate the model into your building management system or energy optimization workflow for real-world applications.


## Data
The repository includes synthetic data generated for the purpose of training and testing the model. You can also replace this data with your own if you have access to relevant sensor data.
